ChangeLog for ndtv
v0.3 - features and bug fixes
 - added weight.attr and weight.dist arguments to compute.animation, making it possible to use numeric edge attributes to specifiy desired distances/similarities in network layouts
 - fixed bug in timeline function that would sometimes draw vertex out of plot range
 - added a draft proximity.timeline function for creating experimental 1D timeline layouts
 - added a render.cache argument to render.animation which makes it possible to avoid intermediate plot generation when rendering long animations
 - added chain.direction option to compute.animation
 - resaved data objects to fix spurious namespace import problem flagged by CRAN
 - fixed bug when network has only single vertex
 - fixed undefiend plot range bug triggered by same condidtion
 - fixed error specifying xlim and ylim in render.animation
 - added parameters to export.dot to make possible exporting vertex and edge attributes to Graphviz
 - removed some workarounds for fixed bugs in network
 - removed edge label plotting code (now supported in network)
 - the attribute aggregation rule element of slice.par now defaults to 'latest', where previously it defaulted to 'any', which gave the behavior of 'earliest' and produced a warning. 
 
v0.2 - minor features and bug fixes
 - added work-around for RStudio plotting errors
 - fixed jittering plots issue
 - improved video save quality by setting default device to png instead of jpeg
 - added crude timeline plot
 - added plot.par and ani.options arguments to render.animation 
 - added suggests dependency on testthat package for tests
 - fixed to use statnetStartupMessage() instead of mkStartupMessage() in statnet.common
 - removed internal implementations of TEA functions and corrected to use networkDynamic
 - fixed and tested compatibility with networks of size 0. 
 - added extraPlotCmds argument to render.animation for passing in more plotting commands for annotation
 - fix for error rendering bipartite networks
 - better handling of defaults for some plot.network arguments

v0.1 - internal test release
